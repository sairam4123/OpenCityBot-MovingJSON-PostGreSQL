# OpenCityBot-MovingJSON-PostGreSQL
_____________________________________

Hello, This is me, **Sairam**, Developer of ***OpenCityBot***.   
I am currently moving the json files as the JSON takes space.  

So, it is better for me to use PostgreSQL for my bot.  

* If you want to contribute for this repository, you can contribute any feature you like, but it should follow **[PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)**.  


Here's how you need to run the bot file. I recommend using PyCharm.  

You need a [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) database.  

If you use PyCharm:
  1. Open the folder as Project.  
  2. Rename .env.example to .env file and replace the TOKEN, DB_URL and more.
  3. Go to terminal
  4. Run this code `pipenv install` (I assume that you have installed pipenv else `pip install pipenv`)
  5. Run this code `python table_creator`
  6. Run the `start.sh`

That's it

If you'd like to have some templates and run configs. Feel free to DM me in [Discord](https://discord.com).
