# OpenCityBot-MovingJSON-PostGreSQL
_____________________________________

Hello, This is me, **Sairam**, Developer of ***OpenCityBot***. 
I am currently moving the json files as the JSON takes space. So, it is better for me to use PostgreSQL for my bot.

* If you want to contribute for this repository, you can contribute any feature you like, but it should follow the pep-8.
